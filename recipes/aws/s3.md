# AWS S3

## HTTP access without enabling static website hosting

You can access access any _public_ S3 bucket over HTTP(S) without enabling static website hosting using this url:
```
http(s)://<bucket>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<path>
```


## CORS settings for use with CloudFront

A correct CORS configuration for S3 looks like this:
```json
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "http://*",
            "https://*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [],
        "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
    }
]
```
Take special note of the `AllowedOrigins`. Don't just specify `*` here, as that will break under certain conditions.

In the origin's behavior on CloudFront:
* "Cache and origin request settings" must be set to "Use legacy cache settings".
* "Cache Based on Selected Request Headers" must be set to "Whitelist".
* "Whitelist Headers" must include "Origin", "Access-Control-Request-Headers" and "Access-Control-Request-Method".


## Secure access from within your VPC

It's possible to restrict access to an S3-hosted static website to your VPC.
The [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html) is quite elaborate, but in short do the following:

* Create a VPC endpoint for S3 (Gateway type) and attach it to your VPC.
    Make sure to update the routing table used by the EC2 instances that will be accessing S3.
* Update the bucket policy to include
    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2008-10-17",
        "Id": "Policy1",
        "Statement": [{
            "Sid": "Access-to-Trusted-VPC-only",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject*",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:sourceVpc": "vpc-id123456"
                }
            }
        }]
    }
    ```
* It's _not_ needed to enable public access.
